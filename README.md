# Fine-Tuned-Image-Classification
This program classifies an image into dog , horse, cat or man. It uses a pretrained resnet51. I have attached custom fully connected layers and only trained them.

Dataset : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TniaUicGImG664S-7JVEhH-I2cKLFEvL

Step 1 : Add the dataset file to your drive

Step 2 : Train the neural network ('Still working in load_model error), run the program till line 107

Step 3 : Upload and test it for any image ( Run the program after line 107)
